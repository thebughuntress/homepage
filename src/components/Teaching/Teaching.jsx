            "I teach because I have always had great teachers who inspired and
            guided me. Their passion for teaching, dedication, and belief in my
            potential made a lasting impact on me. I want to give back what they
            gave meâ€”to help others discover their strengths, ignite their
            curiosity, and achieve their goals. Just as they shaped my path, I
            hope to inspire and empower my students to reach their full
            potential."

            By day, I work as a programmer in an IT consulting company, where I
            have worked on various projects, including web development, cloud,
            and testing. In addition to my work, I have also earned various IT
            certifications in Python and Cloud Engineering. My favorite
            programming language is Python.
